## Supervised Learning: Classification

Some of the most common types of classification problems include:

- Classification on tabular data: The data is available in the form of rows and columns, potentially originating from a wide variety of data sources.
- Classification on image or sound data: The training data consists of images or sounds whose categories are already known.
- Classification on text data: The training data consists of texts whose categories are already known.

- **Binary classification** - The classifier choose from only two categories; each output belongs to one or the other.
- **Multi-class Single-label classification** - The classifier chooses from multiple categories; each output belongs to single category only.
- **Multi-class multi-label classification** - The classifier chooses from multiple categories; each output can belong to one or more categories.
